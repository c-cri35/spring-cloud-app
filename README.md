# Final Project for Spring Cloud Computing Course üçÉ

There are two client services, _user-service_ and _appointment-service_, which are registered using **eureka**. They both use **spring cloud config** to handle different properties that can be found [here](https://github.com/c-cri35/spring-config-server). 

The two services communicate using a Rest Template and are routed by an **API Gateway**. 

To also show the usage of **CircuitBreaker**, a forced configurable delay was introduced to GET _localhost:8080/user/{id}_. If a user tries to create an appointment through the _appointment-service_ and the _user-service_ takes too long to respond to validate the car owner or the car owner is not registered, the appointment cannot be completed.
